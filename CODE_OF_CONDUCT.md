# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We, as contributors and maintainers, commit to creating an open and inclusive environment where everyone can participate in our project and community without facing harassment. We welcome individuals regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We encourage positive behaviors such as:

* Using inclusive and welcoming language

Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Using sexualized language or imagery, or making unwelcome sexual advances
* Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Sharing others' private information without explicit permission
* Engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing these standards and taking action against unacceptable behavior. This includes the right to remove or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban contributors exhibiting inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in project and public spaces where individuals represent the project or community. This representation includes using official project email, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events.

## Enforcement

Maintainers not following or enforcing the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project's leadership.
