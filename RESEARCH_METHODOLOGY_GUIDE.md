# Values and Behavioral Enactment Coder - Research Methodology Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the Values and Behavioral Enactment Coder for qualitative research, with special focus on **taxonomy validation** using both open coding and predefined taxonomy approaches.

## Research Workflow for Taxonomy Validation

### Phase 1: Open Coding (Unrestricted Value Identification)

**Purpose**: Identify values naturally occurring in your data without constraints from existing taxonomies.

#### Step 1: Setup Open Coding Session
1. **Select Files**: Choose your BEI transcripts or other interview data
2. **Choose Mode**: Select "Open Coding" when starting a new session
3. **Configure AI**: Set confidence thresholds (recommend starting with 60%)

#### Step 2: Open Coding Process
1. **AI Suggestions**: 
   - Claude analyzes each text section using general knowledge
   - Suggests 3-5 values per section with confidence scores
   - Provides rationale for each suggested value
   - Suggests categories for emerging values

2. **Human Validation**:
   - Review AI suggestions critically
   - Accept, modify, or reject suggested values
   - Add manual values not identified by AI
   - Provide your own rationale and categorization

3. **Documentation**:
   - Record confidence levels for each coding decision
   - Note patterns in value emergence
   - Track unique values not in existing taxonomies

#### Step 3: Open Coding Analysis
- **Value Frequency Analysis**: Which values appear most often?
- **Category Patterns**: What natural groupings emerge?
- **Coder Reliability**: Compare multiple coders' open coding results
- **Saturation Assessment**: Are new values still emerging?

### Phase 2: Taxonomy Validation Analysis

**Purpose**: Systematically compare open-coded values with your predefined 32-value taxonomy.

#### Step 1: Automated Mapping Analysis
1. **AI-Powered Mapping**: 
   - Claude compares open-coded values to taxonomy values
   - Identifies direct matches, broader categories, and gaps
   - Provides confidence scores for mappings

2. **Mapping Types**:
   - **Direct Match**: Open value maps exactly to taxonomy value
   - **Broader Category**: Open value fits under taxonomy category
   - **Taxonomy Gap**: Open value has no good taxonomy match
   - **Too Specific**: Open value is too narrow/specific

#### Step 2: Gap Analysis
1. **Identify Missing Values**: 
   - Values frequently found in open coding but missing from taxonomy
   - High-confidence open values with no taxonomy match
   - Systematic gaps in particular value categories

2. **Redundancy Analysis**:
   - Taxonomy values never identified in open coding
   - Overlapping or redundant taxonomy categories
   - Values that could be merged or eliminated

3. **Mapping Success Rates**:
   - Percentage of open values successfully mapped
   - Confidence levels of successful mappings
   - Patterns in mapping failures

#### Step 3: Taxonomy Refinement Recommendations
1. **Add Values**: New values to add based on open coding
2. **Modify Values**: Existing values to refine or clarify
3. **Merge Values**: Overlapping values to consolidate
4. **Recategorize**: Values that belong in different categories

### Phase 3: Validation Study Design

#### Multi-Document Analysis
1. **Sample Size**: Code sufficient documents to reach saturation
2. **Document Variety**: Include diverse contexts and participant types
3. **Multiple Coders**: Use 2-3 coders for reliability analysis

#### Comparative Analysis
1. **Open vs Taxonomy**: Compare results from both approaches
2. **Mapping Accuracy**: Validate AI mapping suggestions manually
3. **Inter-rater Reliability**: Measure agreement between coders

#### Statistical Analysis
1. **Frequency Distributions**: Compare value frequencies across approaches
2. **Coverage Analysis**: Percentage of text coded with each approach
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Relationship between open and taxonomy coding

## Coding Modes Explained

### 1. Open Coding Mode
- **Best for**: Initial exploration, theory building, taxonomy development
- **AI Behavior**: Suggests any values identified in text
- **Constraints**: None - uses Claude's general knowledge
- **Output**: Unrestricted list of values with suggested categories

### 2. Taxonomy-Based Coding Mode  
- **Best for**: Hypothesis testing, comparative studies, standardized analysis
- **AI Behavior**: Suggests only values from predefined taxonomy
- **Constraints**: Limited to 32 core values from Phase 0 research
- **Output**: Structured coding using established framework

### 3. Hybrid Coding Mode
- **Best for**: Comprehensive analysis combining both approaches
- **AI Behavior**: Identifies values openly AND maps to taxonomy
- **Constraints**: Shows both unrestricted and constrained results
- **Output**: Open values + taxonomy mappings + gap analysis

### 4. Validation Mode
- **Best for**: Your current research goal (taxonomy validation)
- **AI Behavior**: Two-stage process: open coding â†’ taxonomy mapping
- **Constraints**: Structured comparison workflow
- **Output**: Detailed validation analysis with recommendations

## Best Practices for Taxonomy Validation

### Data Preparation
1. **Clean Transcripts**: Ensure high-quality, complete transcripts
2. **Contextual Information**: Include relevant background for each interview
3. **Consistent Format**: Standardize transcript formatting

### Coding Quality Assurance
1. **Multiple Coders**: Use at least 2 independent coders
2. **Training Phase**: Practice on sample documents first
3. **Regular Calibration**: Meet to discuss coding decisions
4. **Document Decisions**: Keep detailed coding notes

### AI Integration Guidelines
1. **Critical Review**: Always validate AI suggestions
2. **Confidence Thresholds**: Start conservative (70%+) then adjust
3. **Context Consideration**: AI may miss cultural/contextual nuances  
4. **Human Expertise**: Use your domain knowledge to override AI when needed

### Analysis Recommendations
1. **Quantitative Analysis**: Use frequency counts and statistics
2. **Qualitative Analysis**: Deep dive into mapping rationales
3. **Visual Analysis**: Create charts showing value distributions
4. **Narrative Analysis**: Tell the story of what your data reveals

## Expected Research Outcomes

### Taxonomy Validation Results
1. **Coverage Assessment**: How well does the 32-value taxonomy cover your data?
2. **Gap Identification**: What values are missing from the taxonomy?
3. **Redundancy Analysis**: Are there overlapping or unnecessary values?
4. **Cultural Specificity**: Do some values need cultural adaptation?

### Methodological Contributions
1. **AI-Human Collaboration**: Effectiveness of AI-assisted coding
2. **Multi-Mode Comparison**: Benefits of combining open and constrained coding
3. **Workflow Efficiency**: Time savings and quality improvements

### Theoretical Contributions
1. **Refined Taxonomy**: Improved 32-value framework based on empirical data
2. **Value Emergence Patterns**: How values manifest in behavioral narratives
3. **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Applicability across different contexts

## Research Quality Metrics
